While you add Client you will notice it requires lot of parameter and you must not skip any parameter as all are mandatory but you can choose to pass an empty or 0 value accordingly. This is a POST Request 4.12.1 Example Request { \"Client\": { \"TitleID\": 1, \"FirstName\": \"John\", \"SurName\": \"Martin\", \"DateOfBirth\": \"20/01/1990\", \"ClientEmail\": \"test@gmail.com\", \"PhoneHome\": \"07855996633\", \"BusinessPhone\": \"07855996633\", \"PhoneMobile\": \"07855996633\", \"ClientReference\": \"\", \"AgentID\": 1050, \"MailAddress\": { \"Line1\": \"E-123\", \"Line2\": \"\", \"Line3\": \"\", \"Town\": \"Luton\", \"County\": \"\", \"PostalCode\": \"LU1 3EY\", \"NumberOfYearStay\": 0, \"NumberOfMonthStay\": 0 }, \"PhysicalAddress\": { \"Line1\": \"E-123\", \"Line2\": \"\", \"Line3\": \"\", \"Town\": \"Luton\", \"County\": \"\", \"PostalCode\": \"LU1 3EY\", \"NumberOfYearStay\": 0, \"NumberOfMonthStay\": 0 }, \"BankAccountInfo\": { \"AccountID\": 0, \"AccountName\": \"Account Name\", \"AccountNo\": \"11223344\", \"BankName\": \"\", \"Branch\": \"\", \"City\": \"\", \"PostCode\": \"\", \"SortCode\": \"112255\", \"Street\": \"\", \"SubUrb\": \"\", \"ClientRefNo\": \"\", \"Default\": true }, \"MonthlyIncome\": 0, \"MonthlyExpense\": 0 } } The JSON Request for Adding a Client can be split into the following four sections: Basic Client Information Mail Address Physical Address Bank Account Information Basic Information Element DataType MaxLength Required?

The same endpoint is used to create Non Corporate as well as Corporate Agreements unlike two endpoints which are used to create individual client and business client. Before you add an agreement you must have a valid client ID with you. You can create an agreement on existing client or add a new client to get a valid Client ID.
